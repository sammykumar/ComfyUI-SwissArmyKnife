# Seed Widget

**Last Updated**: October 8, 2025  
**Node**: MediaDescribe (formerly GeminiUtilMediaDescribe)

The seed widget enables reproducible randomization for the MediaDescribe node when using "Randomize Media from Path" mode. It solves the ComfyUI execution caching issue where the same media_path wouldn't trigger re-execution.

## Overview

### Key Features

1. **Forces Re-execution**: Changing the seed value makes ComfyUI recognize inputs have changed
2. **Smart Visibility**: Only appears when "Randomize Media from Path" is selected
3. **Easy Randomization**: Includes a "ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed" button for quick seed generation
4. **Reproducible Results**: Same seed produces same file selection for reproducible workflows
5. **Standard Pattern**: Follows the same approach as built-in ComfyUI nodes (KSampler, etc.)

### UI Behavior

**Upload Media Mode:**

- Seed widget: **Hidden**
- Randomize seed button: **Hidden**
- Upload widgets: **Visible**

**Randomize Media from Path Mode:**

- Seed widget: **Visible** (number input, 0 to 18446744073709551615)
- Randomize seed button: **Visible** (ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed)
- Media path widget: **Visible**
- Upload widgets: **Hidden**

## Problem Solved

When using "Randomize Media from Path" mode, ComfyUI's execution engine would skip re-running the node if the `media_path` input stayed the same, because ComfyUI only re-executes nodes when their inputs change. This is standard ComfyUI behavior designed to optimize workflow execution.

### The Issue

**Before the fix:**

- User sets `media_path` to `/path/to/media/`
- Node executes and selects a random file
- User clicks "Queue Prompt" again
- ComfyUI sees: `media_path` hasn't changed â†’ skips re-execution
- Result: Same file is used, no actual randomization happens

### The Solution

**After the fix:**

- User sets `media_path` to `/path/to/media/`
- User sets `seed` to `12345`
- Node executes and selects a random file (using seed 12345)
- User clicks "ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed" to change seed to `67890`
- ComfyUI sees: `seed` has changed â†’ triggers re-execution
- Result: Different file is selected, true randomization works

## Implementation

### Python Backend Changes

**File:** `nodes/nodes.py`

#### Added Seed Parameter

```python
"seed": ("INT", {
    "default": 0,
    "min": 0,
    "max": 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF,
    "tooltip": "Seed for randomization when using 'Randomize Media from Path'. Use different seeds to force re-execution."
}),
```

#### Updated Function Signature

```python
def describe_media(self, gemini_api_key, gemini_model, model_type, description_mode,
                   prefix_text, media_source, media_type, seed, image=None, ...):
```

#### Seed-Based File Selection

```python
# Randomly select a file using the seed for reproducible selection
# When seed changes, a different file may be selected, forcing re-execution
random.seed(seed)
selected_media_path = random.choice(all_files)

# Reset random state to avoid affecting other operations
random.seed(None)
```

### JavaScript Frontend Changes

**File:** `web/js/swiss-army-knife.js`

#### Conditional Widget Visibility

The seed widget is managed in the `updateMediaWidgets()` function:

```javascript
// Show seed widget only for "Randomize Media from Path"
if (mediaSource === 'Randomize Media from Path') {
    seedWidget.hidden = false;
    randomizeSeedButton.hidden = false;
    console.log('[STATE] Showing seed widget for randomization');
} else {
    seedWidget.hidden = true;
    randomizeSeedButton.hidden = true;
    console.log('[STATE] Hiding seed widget for upload mode');
}
```

#### Randomize Seed Button

```javascript
// Add randomize seed button for convenience
this.randomizeSeedWidget = this.addWidget(
    'button',
    'ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed',
    'randomize_seed',
    () => {
        this.onRandomizeSeedButtonPressed();
    },
);
```

#### Random Seed Generation

```javascript
nodeType.prototype.onRandomizeSeedButtonPressed = function () {
    const seedWidget = this.widgets.find((w) => w.name === 'seed');
    if (seedWidget) {
        // Generate a random seed (large integer)
        const randomSeed = Math.floor(Math.random() * 0xffffffffffffffff);
        seedWidget.value = randomSeed;
        console.log(`[SEED] Generated random seed: ${randomSeed}`);

        // Trigger widget update to ensure ComfyUI recognizes the change
        if (seedWidget.callback) {
            seedWidget.callback(randomSeed);
        }
    }
};
```

### Console Logging

The implementation includes debug logging for verification:

```
[STATE] Showing seed widget for randomization
[STATE] Hiding seed widget for upload mode
[SEED] Generated random seed: 1234567890123456789
```

## Usage

### For "Randomize Media from Path" Mode

1. **Set media_source** to "Randomize Media from Path"
2. **Specify media_path** to your directory containing images/videos
3. **Use the seed widget** to control randomization:

    **Option A - Manual Entry:**
    - Enter any number (0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615)
    - Same seed = same file selection (reproducible)

    **Option B - Automatic Randomization:**
    - Click "ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed" button
    - Instantly generates a random seed value
    - Forces new file selection on next execution

4. **Execute workflow**:
    - Click "Queue Prompt"
    - Node selects a file based on seed
    - Change seed and re-queue for different file

### For "Upload Media" Mode

- Seed widget is automatically hidden (not relevant for uploaded files)
- Upload your own media files directly

### Workflow Tips

**For Random Selection Every Time:**

- Click "ðŸŽ² Randomize Seed" before each execution
- Each execution will select a potentially different file

**For Reproducible Workflows:**

- Set a specific seed value (e.g., 42)
- Share workflows with that seed
- Others will get the same file selection from their directories

---

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

ComfyUI's execution engine compares all input values to determine if a node needs re-execution:

**Before the seed widget:**

- Only `media_path` was checked â†’ same path = no re-execution

**After the seed widget:**

- Both `media_path` AND `seed` are checked â†’ different seed = re-execution

This follows the same pattern used by other ComfyUI nodes like samplers (KSampler, KSamplerAdvanced, etc.) that include seed parameters for reproducible randomization.

### Technical Benefits

1. **Standard Pattern**: Uses the same approach as built-in ComfyUI nodes
2. **Performance**: Only shows seed widget when needed (clean UI)
3. **User-Friendly**: One-click randomization with the dice button (ðŸŽ²)
4. **Persistent**: Seed value is properly saved/restored with workflows
5. **Reproducible**: Same seed always selects the same file from a directory
6. **Large Range**: Supports seeds from 0 to 2^64-1 (18 quintillion values)

### Seed Range

- **Min**: 0
- **Max**: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
- **Default**: 0
- **Type**: Integer (INT)

### Random File Selection Logic

```python
# Get all files from directory
all_files = [list of media files from media_path]

# Use seed for reproducible randomization
random.seed(seed)
selected_media_path = random.choice(all_files)

# Reset random state to avoid affecting other operations
random.seed(None)
```

This ensures:

- Same seed + same directory = same file selection
- Different seed + same directory = potentially different file
- Reproducible workflows across different systems

## Testing Verification

All functionality has been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Python parameter validation and function signature
2. **Integration Tests**: Full node execution with seed parameter
3. **UI Tests**: Widget visibility and button functionality simulation
4. **Code Quality**: Linting with ruff (all checks passed)

### Test Scenarios

âœ… **Seed changes trigger re-execution**

- Same media_path, different seed â†’ node re-executes

âœ… **Seed visibility toggles correctly**

- "Upload Media" â†’ seed hidden
- "Randomize Media from Path" â†’ seed visible

âœ… **Randomize button works**

- Click button â†’ seed value changes
- Widget callback triggers â†’ ComfyUI recognizes change

âœ… **Workflow persistence**

- Save workflow with seed value
- Load workflow â†’ seed value restored
