# Resource Monitor - Floating Heads-Up Monitor Bar

**Status**: Phase 2 frontend + restart flow complete
**Component**: Web JavaScript Extension (`web/js/resource_monitor.js`)

## Overview

The Resource Monitor extension draws a floating glass "heads-up" bar in the ComfyUI viewport that streams live CPU/RAM/GPU telemetry **and** exposes an always-visible Restart button. The widget detaches from the legacy dropdown entry in `swiss-army-knife.js` so that operators can trigger a restart while simultaneously watching resource pressure build in real time.

Key Capabilities:
- Fixed, centered monitor bar injected directly into `document.body` (not the top toolbar)
- Inline CPU, RAM, temperature, GPU utilization, and VRAM stats rendered with gradient fills
- Automatic discovery of the hardware that is actually available from the backend
- Fully wired restart workflow: confirmation toasts, `/swissarmyknife/restart` POST, `/system_stats` health polling, and cache-busting reload
- WebSocket live updates via `api.addEventListener("swissarmyknife.monitor", handler)` so the UI stays in sync after the initial REST fetch

## Extension Registration & Setup Flow

1. `app.registerExtension({ name: "comfyui_swissarmyknife.resource_monitor", setup })` wires the feature into ComfyUI.
2. During `setup()` the extension:
   - Injects the style tag `#swissarmyknife-restart-button-styles` that defines the floating glassmorphism wrapper, gradient logic, and button micro-interactions.
   - Performs an initial `fetch("/swissarmyknife/monitor/status")` to understand which monitors should render.
   - Dynamically builds monitor cells through `createMonitorDisplay(label, id)` based on backend capabilities (psutil / pynvml availability, detected GPUs, exposed temperatures, etc.).
   - Appends the Restart button returned from `createRestartButton()` after the telemetry cells.
   - Appends the completed wrapper to `document.body` so it floats independently of the toolbar DOM hierarchy.
   - Subscribes to `swissarmyknife.monitor` events on the ComfyUI API bridge, which surface the backend push updates every ~2 seconds.

## UI Layout & Styling

The wrapper `#swissarmyknife-resource-monitor` is positioned `fixed` at `top: 50px` and horizontally centered with `left: 50%` + `transform: translateX(-50%)`. It uses a translucent background, blur filter, rounded 16px corners, and an inset highlight so it reads like a lightweight HUD.

Each telemetry cell (`.swissarmyknife-monitor`) displays `LABEL VALUE` pairs:
- CPU % and RAM (GB used) render whenever psutil is available.
- CPU temperature renders when exposed by the backend sensors.
- For every GPU device the backend reports as `available`, the UI renders utilization %, VRAM usage, and (optionally) GPU temp rows. Labels include a compact per-GPU suffix (e.g., `GPU 0 (3090Ti)`, `VRAM 0 (A6000)`), generated by `extractGPUModel()`.
- Cells call `updateMonitorValue(id, value, percent)` whenever new data arrives. The helper paints a linear gradient from left to right using thresholds `<50% (green #22c55e)`, `<70% (yellow #eab308)`, `<90% (orange #f97316)`, and `>=90% (red #ef4444)` to immediately communicate pressure.

The Restart button shares the wrapper so the operator can watch the monitors while the restart is underway. It follows the ComfyUI `.comfyui-button` base class with custom danger colors, disabled state, and a divider pseudo-element (`::before`) to visually separate it from the monitors.

## Restart Workflow

`createRestartButton()` wires the full restart experience:
1. Disable + relabel the button to "Restarting..." and push a Toast (`app.extensionManager.toast.add`) describing what is happening.
2. Fire `fetch("/swissarmyknife/restart", { method: "POST" })`. Any network failure is ignored because the backend tears down the HTTP connection during restart.
3. Wait 2 seconds for shutdown to start, then poll `/system_stats` every second (up to 60s) until a 200 OK proves the server is alive again.
4. When the health check succeeds, pop a success toast and hard reload `window.location.reload(true)` to pick up new JS bundles without a stale cache.
5. If the timeout expires, re-enable the button and warn the operator that manual refresh might be required.
6. All errors propagate to the console with the `[SwissArmyKnife][ResourceMonitor]` prefix and surface a Toast that explains the failure.

The behavior mirrors the menu command restart logic, but the inline placement plus stateful button make the process much more discoverable.

## Data Sources & Update Loop

- **Initial snapshot**: `GET /swissarmyknife/monitor/status` returns `{ hardware, gpu }`. The UI uses this payload to decide which tiles to render (e.g., no psutil => only GPU tiles, no pynvml => skip utilization tiles, etc.).
- **Live updates**: The backend broadcasts `swissarmyknife.monitor` events. `handleMonitorUpdate()` consumes the payload, runs the formatters (`formatGB`, `formatPercent`, `formatTemp`, `formatGHz`) and updates every matching tile.
- **Health checks**: Restart logic pings `/system_stats` because it is small, unauthenticated, and always hosted by ComfyUI itself.
- **Debug logs**: Controlled by `SwissArmyKnife.debug_mode`. When enabled the console prints setup/start/end banners, AJAX failures, and periodic polling output (every 5 attempts during restart polling).

## Dependency Matrix & Graceful Degradation

| Backend Dependency | UI Impact |
|--------------------|-----------|
| `psutil`           | CPU %, RAM, CPU Temp tiles render. Without it, those tiles are simply not created. |
| `py-cpuinfo`       | Used server-side to enrich CPU labels; UI automatically falls back to `--` when a value is missing. |
| `torch`            | Enables VRAM reporting when pynvml is absent. The UI still displays VRAM rows because the backend formats the bytes. |
| `pynvml`           | Unlocks GPU utilization and temperature metrics. Without it only VRAM tiles (and restart) appear. |

No JavaScript errors are thrown when a capability is missing; the UI just renders the tiles that make sense for the current machine.

## Browser Refresh Requirements

Because this is a pure JavaScript widget, no ComfyUI restart is required. Developers should perform a hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R) whenever `resource_monitor.js` changes to force the new bundle to load and to re-inject the CSS.

## Future Enhancements

- Clear VRAM button and backend endpoint wiring
- Per-tile context menus (click to copy usage, open GPU inspector, etc.)
- Visibility presets so laptop users can hide GPU tiles
- Historical sparklines per metric
- Settings surface for sampling interval + toast verbosity

Keep the file-level documentation synchronized with each feature drop so operators know which telemetry to expect.
