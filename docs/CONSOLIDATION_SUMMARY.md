    - Could be organized into 3-4 comprehensive documents
    - Implementation guide, variants, and integrations

2. **Media Describe Documentation** (20 files)
    - Could consolidate override-related files
    - Prompt breakdown files could be merged
    - API and utility files could be combined

3. **Caching Infrastructure** (6 files)
    - Could merge verification summaries
    - Combine optimization and busting guides

### Maintenance Guidelines

1. **When adding new documentation**:
    - Check if it fits into existing consolidated files
    - Only create new files for distinct new features
    - Update README files to reflect additions

2. **When updating documentation**:
    - Update consolidated files, not individual fragments
    - Keep table of contents current
    - Update cross-references as needed

3. **Regular reviews**:
    - Quarterly review for consolidation opportunities
    - Remove obsolete documentation
    - Update organization as project evolves
