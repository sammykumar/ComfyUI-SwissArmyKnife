# Docker ComfyUI-Manager Integration Fix

## Issue Description

After adding ComfyUI-Manager to the Docker image, the container failed to start with the following error:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'git'
Cannot import /workspace/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-manager module for custom nodes: No module named 'git'
```

## Root Cause

ComfyUI-Manager requires several Python dependencies that were not installed in the Docker environment, particularly:

- `GitPython` (provides the `git` module)
- `PyGithub` (for GitHub API integration)
- `matrix-nio` (for Matrix protocol support)
- `transformers` (for AI model loading)
- `huggingface-hub` (for Hugging Face integration)
- `typer`, `rich`, `typing-extensions`, `toml`, `uv`, `chardet` (utility libraries)

## Solution

The fix involved properly installing ComfyUI-Manager's dependencies by adding its `requirements.txt` file installation to the Dockerfile:

### Before (Broken)

```dockerfile
# Install ComfyUI-Manager
RUN cd custom_nodes && \
    git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git comfyui-manager
```

### After (Fixed)

```dockerfile
# Install ComfyUI-Manager
RUN cd custom_nodes && \
    git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git comfyui-manager

# Install ComfyUI-Manager dependencies (includes GitPython and other required packages)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r custom_nodes/comfyui-manager/requirements.txt
```

## Implementation Details

1. **Dependency Installation Order**: ComfyUI-Manager dependencies are installed after cloning the repository to ensure the `requirements.txt` file is available.

2. **Removed Redundant Dependencies**: Previously manually added `GitPython` and `requests` are now handled by the ComfyUI-Manager requirements file.

3. **Complete Dependency Coverage**: The requirements.txt file includes all necessary dependencies for ComfyUI-Manager functionality.

## ComfyUI-Manager Requirements

The full list of dependencies installed from `comfyui-manager/requirements.txt`:

```
GitPython
PyGithub
matrix-nio
transformers
huggingface-hub>0.20
typer
rich
typing-extensions
toml
uv
chardet
```

## Verification

After applying this fix, ComfyUI should start successfully with ComfyUI-Manager available in the Manager menu.

## Related Files

- `Dockerfile`: Updated to include ComfyUI-Manager dependency installation
- Docker container logs should no longer show git module import errors

## Future Considerations

- Monitor ComfyUI-Manager updates for changes in dependencies
- Consider pinning ComfyUI-Manager to a specific version for stability
- Test new ComfyUI-Manager versions in development before deploying to production

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Build the Docker image: `docker-compose build`
2. Start the container: `docker-compose up`
3. Check that ComfyUI starts without import errors
4. Verify the Manager menu appears in ComfyUI web interface
5. Test installing a custom node via ComfyUI-Manager
