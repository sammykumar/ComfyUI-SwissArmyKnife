# Video Resizing - Quick Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Video resizing functionality has been successfully added to the Media Selection node!

## What Was Added

### New Functionality

- Videos can now be resized just like images
- Three resize modes supported:
    1. **None** - Keep original dimensions
    2. **Auto (by orientation)** - Smart sizing based on aspect ratio
    3. **Custom** - Specify exact dimensions

### Auto Resize Dimensions

- **Landscape videos** (wider than tall): **832×480**
- **Portrait videos** (taller than wide): **480×832**

### Custom Resize

- Set any dimensions using `resize_width` and `resize_height` parameters
- Default: 832×480

## How It Works

1. **Scale**: Video is resized to fit one dimension while maintaining aspect ratio
2. **Crop**: Center crop to exact target dimensions
3. **Encode**: High-quality H.264 encoding with fast preset
4. **Audio**: Audio stream copied without re-encoding (faster)

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

- `nodes/media_selection/media_selection.py`
    - Added `_resize_video()` method
    - Updated `_process_video()` to support resizing
    - Updated `select_media()` to pass resize parameters

### Files Created

- `docs/nodes/media-selection/VIDEO_RESIZE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Full implementation details
- Updated `docs/nodes/media-selection/README.md` - Added resize documentation

## Usage Example

In your ComfyUI workflow:

1. Add a **Media Selection** node
2. Set `media_type` to **video**
3. Choose `resize_mode`:
    - **"Auto (by orientation)"** for automatic sizing
    - **"Custom"** to specify exact dimensions
4. If using Custom mode, set `resize_width` and `resize_height`

The node will output the resized video with updated dimensions!

## Requirements

- **FFmpeg** must be installed on your system
- Already handles graceful fallback if FFmpeg is not available

## What This Fixes

### Before

- Video resizing was **not implemented**
- Videos always kept original dimensions (e.g., 1920×1080)
- Only images could be resized

### After

- Videos and images both support resizing
- Consistent behavior across media types
- Proper aspect ratio handling with center cropping
- High-quality output

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Load a video (any source)
2. Set resize mode to "Auto (by orientation)"
3. For a landscape video, output should be 832×480
4. For a portrait video, output should be 480×832
5. Check the console for resize confirmation messages

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready to use! The resizing will work automatically when you:

- Set `resize_mode` to anything other than "None"
- Have FFmpeg installed on your system
- Process videos through the Media Selection node
